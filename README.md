## ImGuiWindow-rs

Written in Rust using imgui-rs, ImGuiWindow-rs is a package comprised of an application, event loop, and additional modules the user can utilize to quickly get going on their next project. Designed and tested on Windows 10, this package can be easily modified to work on other platforms as well, thanks to ImGui's platform independence.  Feel free to use and contribute to this project!
