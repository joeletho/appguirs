## ImGuiWindow-rs

Written in Rust using imgui-rs, ImGuiWindow-rs is a package comprised of an application, event loop, and additional modules the user can utilize to quickly get going on their next project. Currently tested on both Windows 10 and MacOS BigSur, this package can be easily modified to work on other platforms as well thanks to ImGui's platform agnosticism. Feel free to use and contribute to this project! 

### How to get going: 
Be sure have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then run the following in your favorite terminal: 
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joeletho/imgui_window_rs.git 
cd imgui_window_rs
cargo run
```
and behold!
