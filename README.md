## AppGui-rs

Written in Rust using imgui-rs, AppGuiRs is a package that allows users to quickly get their gui application up and running by providing an application loop and a blank gui window ready to be populated. Currently tested on both Windows 10 and MacOS BigSur, this package can be easily modified to work on other platforms as well thanks to ImGui's platform agnosticism. Feel free to use and contribute to this project! 

### How to get going: 
Be sure have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then run the following in your favorite terminal: 
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joeletho/appguirs.git 
cd appguirs
cargo run
```
and behold!
